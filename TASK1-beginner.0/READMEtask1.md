TASK 1: Memes + Readme

1) The Team Leader has to create a Public Repository with your project name and has to add every other team member as a Contributor. This repo has to be initialized with a README.

2)Each member has to create a branch on the repo, add a coding-related meme in a folder called 'memes' and then create a pull request to the 'main' branch.

3) Merge all the above pull requests.

4) Write down all details related to your project (Project Name, Project Description, Team members etc) in the README.md file  
You can refer to this tutorial for Readme Markdown files: Markdown syntax Cheat sheet - YouTube

5) Push the files to the repository.

6) While pushing the files first pull the latest changes and then push your changes.

If stuck anywhere, you can always take help from your mentors!
